title: About

My name is Kristen and I am a senior in the [Honors Tutorial College](https://www.ohio.edu/honors/) computer science program at Ohio University. I am very interested in music information retrieval, machine learning, music production, bass guitar, and programming in general. 

This site is meant to be a nontraditional blog of sorts–––a way for me to document my progress as I further pursue all of the previously mentioned areas. I will also be keeping it up-to-date with my research publications.

My GitHub handle is [kristenmasada](https://github.com/kristenmasada). I currently do not have as much public code on my profile as I would like, but plan to add more in the coming year.

Feel free to contact me at km942412[at]ohio[dot]edu.
