My name is Kristen and I am currently a Master's student in computer science working under [Dr. Razvan Bunescu](http://ace.cs.ohiou.edu/~razvan/) at Ohio University. I am interested in music information retrieval, machine learning, music production, and programming in general. 


Feel free to contact me at km942412[at]ohio[dot]edu.
