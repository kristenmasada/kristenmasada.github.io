* Add SEO plugin so that page shows up in Google searches.
* Bold/underline title of page you're currently on in menu (maybe do this w/ JS).

* Eventually add link to code for package + data + instructions on GitHub and link to this on 'Publications' page.

* Might want to look at other people's GitHub Page repos for other ideas.
