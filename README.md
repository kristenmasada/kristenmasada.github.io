# TODO
* Change homepage to 'About' page.
* Remove link to blog posts page.
  * Keep files with blog layout though, in case I want to make blog posts in the future.
* Bold/underline title of page you're currently on in menu (maybe do this w/ JS).
* Remove white line in title that appears on mobile.
* Center text on 'About' page properly.

* Eventually add link to code for package + data + instructions on GitHub and link to this on 'Publications' page.
* Remove weird space between bullet points on 'Publications' page.

* Add Google Analytics? so that page shows up in Google searches.

* Add links to other pages, such as GitHub and LinkedIn.
* Would also like to add a Vim cheatsheet.

* Might want to look at other people's GitHub Page repos for other ideas.
